# Weather-App

 Weather app:

was created: HTML, SCSS, JS

used: 
- adaptive layout in mobile browsers
- remote server for fetching data
- mocked data, (it will show "night" mode because of outdated sunrise/sunset data). 
  (inctr/for me: for real data - update url constant in weather.js file with my url from https://openweathermap.org/forecast5 )
